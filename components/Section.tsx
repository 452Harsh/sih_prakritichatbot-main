                What are Prakritis?

                Some people have an equal amount of all three elements (ether is combined in air and earth within water). Thus a more air-predominant individual needs to take in less air and more fire and water. A water person already has an excess of water, so there is a need to reduce the intake of water and to increase the fire and air elements in the diet and lifestyle.

                Vata Prakriti
            </p>
            <p className='pt-8 font-serif flex justify-center text-xl'>
                Vata prakriti means, when there is dominance of the Vata Dosha over rest of the two doshas.Thin frame people (mostly) either tall or short. These Vata prakriti people can adapt to any condition, very easily. They are careless. Quick and impatient. They want to learn everything but they know least in depth. Irregular patterns in life is the truth of these people. Likewise Air, they move from one place to another place. Easily get upset, but forgets everything quicker than that. In one word they are- impulsive.

                Pitta Prakriti
            </p>
            <p className='pt-8 font-serif flex justify-center text-xl'>
                Emotional, perfectionist and always in time are the Pitta persons. They are sharp. Very aggressive. Their reasoning and logic is always on a stronger side. This makes pitta people leaders. They believe in making decisions very pin-pointedly. They express the feeling with anger, mostly. But inside they are emotional and sensitive, most of the times. Grey hairs or no hairs, is an easy trait to find them around you.

                Kapha Prakriti
            </p>
            <p className='pt-8 font-serif flex justify-center text-xl'>
                When Kapha is excessive, they tend toward water excesses like water retention, being overweight, or having bronchitis. Mentally, they will find themselves lethargic, too attached, and sentimental. As we discussed earlier, each person is made up of a combination of these elements, yet each usually has a combination predominantly of two or all three of these elements. These elements in turn, form three physiological principles, VÃ¡yu (ether and air), Pitta (fire), and Kapha (water and earth). Like the elements, people are predominantly made up of one or more or these doshas.
